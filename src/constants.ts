/**
 * /(\d{0,10})([^\s\d]+)/g
 *
 * This regex pattern /(\d{0,10})([^\s\d]+)/g aims to match and
 * a sequence of digits (0-9) of up to 10 characters, captured in the first group.
 * A series of one or more non-whitespace, non-digit characters, captured in
 * the second group.
 *
 * No regex is perfect. It is recommended that you clean any input
 * you are using, especially if it originates from an uncontrolled source
 * such as a user typing input into an input field on the internet.
 *
 * - (\d{0,10}):
 * This part captures a sequence of digits (0-9) that can occur between
 * 0 and 10 times. The parentheses ( ) indicate a capturing group, which
 * means the matched digits will be stored and accessible separately.
 *
 * - ([^\s\d]+): This part captures one or more characters that are not
 * whitespace and not digits. The square brackets [ ] define a character
 * class, and the ^ at the beginning of the class negates it. So [^\s\d]
 * matches any character that is not a whitespace character or a digit.
 * The + quantifier specifies that one or more characters should be matched.
 *
 * - g:
 * The g flag stands for "global" and indicates that the regex should
 * search for all matches in the input string, rather than stopping after
 * the first match.
 *
 * A few examples of acceptable inputs are:
 *
 * 1y 2M 3w 4d 5h 6m 7s 8ms
 *
 * 1yr 2mos 3wks 4dys 5hrs 6mins 7secs 8mss
 *
 * 2years 1month 3weeks 4days

/**
 * /^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+$/
 *
 * This regex pattern ensures that the entire input string consists of
 * one or more uppercase or lowercase letters, digits, or whitespace
 * characters. It does not allow any other characters in the string.
 *
 * This Regex, combined with some other strategies should
 * help reduce the vulnerability. It is still recommended to clean any input
 * you are using, especially if it originates from an uncontrolled source
 * such as a user typing input into an input field on the internet.
 *
 * - ^:
 * This anchor asserts the start of the string. It specifies that the
 * matching pattern should start at the beginning of the string.
 *
 * - [a-zA-Z0-9\s]+: This character set specifies the allowed characters
 * in the string. It matches one or more occurrences (+) of any uppercase
 * or lowercase letter ([a-zA-Z]), digit (0-9), or whitespace character (\s).
 *
 * - $: This anchor asserts the end of the string. It specifies that the
 * matching pattern should end at the end of the string.
 *
 * "Hello123": This input matches the pattern because it consists of
 * only letters and digits.
 *
 * "Test String": This input matches the pattern because it consists of
 * only letters and whitespace characters.
 *
 * "123-456": This input does not match the pattern because it contains
 * a hyphen character, which is not allowed.
 *
 * "@#$": This input does not match the pattern because it contains special
 * characters that are not part of the allowed character set.
